## üìñ Documentation

Documentation is available via DocC. For Xcode users simply go to `Product > Build Documentation` or press `‚åÉ‚áß‚åòD`. For others the documentation is available in the [releases](https://github.com/Lancelotbronner/swift-raylib/releases) as a website you can run locally.

## üèó Getting Started

### Install Raylib

You should start by installing raylib as a system library. 

The easiest way is via one of the [supported package managers](https://repology.org/project/raylib/versions). Here are a few common examples.

**macOS - Homebrew**
```sh
brew install raylib
```

**Linux - AUR**
```sh
apt-get install raylib
```

**Windows - vcpkg**
```sh
vcpkg install raylib
```

If package managers aren't a possibility, [check raylib's instructions](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib#build-and-installation).

You can then add `swift-raylib` as a dependency. If using SwiftPM, add the following line to your dependencies.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Lancelotbronner/swift-raylib.git", from: "4.5.0")
```

You can use the following modules.

```swift
import Raylib

// If you need to interop with the C library directly
import CRaylib
```
